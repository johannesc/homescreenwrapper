homescreenwrapper
=================

Simple Android homescreen application that launches another (com.fibaro.tablet/com.fibaro.tablet.SplashActivity) application.

It also listens for SCREEN_ON and SCREEN_OFF and launches com.android.settings/.Settings if the screen is turned on again within 10s.

This is used in Android based photo frame (from http://www.elclcd.com/).
